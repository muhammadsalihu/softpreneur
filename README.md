# Softpreneur

- This Project is dedicated to Ibrahim Abdulrahman (Former CEO of Motionwares who sadly passed away last year)

- Here is a tribute video dedicated to Ibrahim by the Motionwares Family: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JwXWBc0SuM&t=3s

- If you come across this ReadME, please say a prayer for Ibrahim. He was a great Leader who advocated for the culture of Inifinite Game (https://www.kernel.community/en/build/games/infinite/)

- I encourage you to take a look at his Instagram Page(https://www.instagram.com/softpreneur/), most especially the captions on his personal posts. 

- In Future Iteration of this project, his works will be minted as an NFT and deployed to the Blockchain. 

The Next Iteration of this project will also be to build MotionwaresDAO as a Network State (Inspired by Balajis work). 

The following resources will be utilised as a sequel to build upon this work:
